Assembling Labeled Dataset

1. Choosing Crystal Classifications
    - FCC, BCC, and HCP to start
    - Simple and straight forward and I think it's easier enough to put more labels if need be (though I'm not sure)
2. Acquiring Data from Materials Project
    - We'll pull .cif (Crystallogrphic Information Files) using Pymatgen
    -  Pymatgen will give us a Structure object
