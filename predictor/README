What script does:

- Load the saved model and encoder.
- Check which mode you want to run.
    - If csv mode: It will perform the batch prediction on a pre-processed CSV.
    - If cif mode: It will find all .cif files in the folder you provide, run the RDF calculation on each one, and predict them one by one.

How to run:
(You must run it in the terminal)

CSV Mode:
Command: `python predict.py csv --input new_batch.csv --output batch_results.csv`
- This assumes you have a file named new_batch.csv that is already formatted with g(r) columns

CIF Mode:
Command `python predict.py cif --input my_new_cifs --output cif_results.csv`
- This assumes you have a folder named my_new_cifs containing your .cif file(s)
