# --- for rdf_ase.py NOT rdf.py---
- any structural file needs to be able to be read by ase.io
- the csv output by .export_rdf has ngrid # of data points
- implement normalization of the radial distribution function (for ML algo) at some point
- We need to be able to format the data like so:


struct    g(r_1) . . . . . g(r_N)       label
1         norm_val_1 . . . norm_val_N   BCC
.         .                             .
.         .                             .
.         .                             .
N         norm_val_N                    Crys_Struct_Label_N


# --- physical meaning of sigma value (gaussian smearing) ---

- sigma is a multiplier relative to the width of the histogram bins

- bin_width = rmax/nbins
- and then sigma broadens by x bins

--- example ---
rmax = 12 Ang ; nbins = 200 bins
bin_width = 0.06 Ang/bin
sigma = 3 means that we are broadening by 3 bins * 0.06 Ang/bin = 0.18Ang

# ---
nbins = 200 # moderate amount of resolution
rmax = 5 # for computational purposes

0.025 * x = 0.1
For .1 Angs of broadening we need a sigma value of 4


---
I wonder if it matters that the ML algorithm wouldn't know what the actual r_N values are, just that there are 200 of them.
